<h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Antibodies that recognize modified histones are essential tools in epigenetic research. 
    Histone modification antibodies in particular require careful validation as those often share the same epitope amino acid sequence, 
    but only slightly differ between the possible post-translational modifications (PTM), e.g. acetylation (ac), mono-methylation (me1), di-methylation (me2), 
    tri-methylation (me3), phosphorylation (ph), ubiquitination (ub) and others, as well as combinations thereof.</p>

    <p>Although manufacturers extensively characterize antibodies for many different applications (e.g. immunoblot, immunofluorescence, chromatin-immunoprecipitation, 
    etc.) before market launch, still the problem is a lack of an uniform standard operating procedure for full validation in order to gain knowledge about 
    antibodies’ on- and off-target binding essential for interpretation of experimental data. Effort to characterize histone PTM antibodies have been published 
    previously (Bock et al., 2011; Egelhofer et al., 2011; Heubach et al., 2013), however, different methods have been applied that do not allow a thorough comparison 
    of antibody validation results.</p>

    <p>Our contribution to the epigenetics research community is a comprehensive characterization of specificities of 125 commercially available histone antibodies 
    raised against x different modifications by a quantitative peptide-based dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescence immunoassay (DELFIA) provided as an open 
    web resource. Aim of this website is to share validation data as a guide for choosing suitable antibodies for different applications. We describe on-target binding 
    and cross-selectivities of antibodies and categorized histone PTM antibodies based on their specificity and sensitivity. Moreover, we provide an unique filtering 
    function for search queries.</p>

    <p>We profiled the binding of mainly monoclonal antibodies against a panel of x synthetic histone modification peptides, as monoclonal antibodies have the 
    advantage of consistency among different lots, while inherent variability between different lots of the same polyclonal antibody due to the immunological 
    state of the animal has been reported. To summarize, one third of tested antibodies are specific for their respective histone PTM, whereas most antibodies failed 
    our criteria. We advise to carefully characterize antibodies before use.</p>

<h4>Querying and browsing data</h4>
<p>Data on specificities of 125 commercial histone modification antibodies for x modified peptides are assembled in an open web source database with graphical display and filtering functions. Specificity and sensitivity: absence of primary epitope (false positives, FP), loss or reduction of binding although PTM is present (false negative, FN). Also less specific antibodies might be suitable for certain application, e.g. in biochemical assays off-targets may be neglected, as those are not in the test tube. The users should take the validation data as a guide. 
Graphical representation of selectivity plots: x-axis different peptides tested, y-axis signal intensity measured, on-targets to be detected by respective antibody are highlighted in blue. The antibody table gives information on the histone PTM antibody, CatNr, LotNr, company, and category. The peptide table give information on the peptide sequence. Heatmap as graphical output.

<h4>Data</h4>

<h5>Antibody classifications according to sensitivity and selectivity</h5>
    <p>Pie chart representing 125 tested commercially available histone PTM antibodies classified into 9 groups according to their sensitivity and selectivity for their cognitive epitopes. Antibodies were classified into 9 categories based on two different criteria: positive predictive value PPV=TP/(TP+FP), used as a proxy for specificity, and sensitivity S=TP/(TP+FN). For not classified antibodies the respective epitope peptide was not tested.</p>
